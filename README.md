# WrangleOpenStreetMapData

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to choose any area of the world in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging 
techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, 
to clean the OpenStreetMap data. We also use MongoDB to explore the data.

## OSM Data
We will use OpenStreetMap to download data on Santa Cruz County. I attended university in Santa Cruz and thought 
familiarity in the area would keep me interested. A compressed version of the data can be found at 
https://github.com/jpmartee/WrangleOpenStreetMapData/blob/master/auditing/santa-cruz_california.osm.zip.
