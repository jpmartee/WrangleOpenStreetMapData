After cleaning it up, we will rewrite the data as a JSON file and upload it to MongoDB. We can use MongoDB to write queries on the data.

There are a few Avenues, Roads, Drives, and Streets written as Ave, Rd, Dr, and St respectively. To make the data consistent, we want to chage Ave to Avenue, Rd to Road, etc. We also want to look up Cedar, Chestnut, Front, Merrill, Pacific, and Seabright on another map and see if they are Streets, Avenues, or Roads and change them accordingly.

One user claims that OSM id's are composed of type of object, id, version, and combination of tags.

These amenities don't necessarily need specific addresses or postal codes. With that said, the amount of restaurants and places of worship outnumber the amout of documents with postal codes. Therefore, the data can be improved by adding complete addresses where needed. \n",

    "Adding postal codes to addresses can be quite challenging. Not all documents include a city. We can use a different strategy, like basing postal codes on streets. But if we try to update postal codes based on street names, we run into problems when streets, such as Soquel Avenue, span multiple cities. With some knowledge of Santa Cruz County, we can write code for streets that we know span just one area. For example, if we know that Pacific Avenue has a beginning and end within the postal code 95060, then we can update the postal code for all documents with street Pacific Avenue.\n",

    "We will always need to audit and clean our data, but the process can be made easier if we have accurate user input. I suggest that anyone interested in inputing or cleaning OSM data for Santa Cruz to get in touch with users in the area, such as stevea, as he is trying to develop practice for consistent input and refine tags that are used for specific amenities. It sounds like a fun project to take on as a hobby!"
